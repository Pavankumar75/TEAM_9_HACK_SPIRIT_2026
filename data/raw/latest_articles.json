        "full_text": "Sports  Techie ASB GlassFloor, the LED floor technology behind the NBA\u2019s All-Star Weekend, have announced a partnership with Disguise, the company powering concert visuals for artists including Adele and Beyonc\u00e9, to upgrade sports courts into digital platforms for fans, teams and sponsors. Disguise and ASB GlassFloor are turning an arena floor into technology-driven, customizable interactive digital surface. The Sports Techie community blog followers and readers, it\u2019s like playing on an NBA 2k style basketball floor complete with game planning capabilities, augmented reality experiences and sponsor driven advertisement activations during a live game, at practice, and whenever the building is in use for other events and activities other than basketball throughout the year. GlassCourt OS This budding strategic relationship flourishes in the cloud thanks to Disguise configuring their servers to host ASB GlassFloor\u2019s operational system feed for the digital court,\u00a0GLASSCOURT OS. GlassCourt\u00a0OS is the software ecosystem that powers the\u00a0LumiFlex\u00a0ASB\u00a0GlassFloor, allowing the sports surface to become fully interactive.\u00a0The intelligent software transforms the ASB GlassFloor into a living, responsive, data-driven sports surface. Adopting the Disguise environment means that, on top of the GLASSCOURT OS solutions, ASB GlassFloor now enables all venues to use the most state-of-the-art media servers in the industry to directly feed interactive content to the floor.\u00a0 \u201cThrough initiatives like our ASB GlassFloor Athletes Lab, we\u2019ve already helped NBA coaches draw plays on their iPad, and see them instantly show up on the digital court floor, alongside real-time player data,\u201d says CEO of ASB GlassFloor, Christof Babinsky. \u201cBy partnering with Disguise, we aim to take things even further. We previously worked with Disguise on an interactive LED court at the NBA\u2019s All Star Weekend in 2024 and other events. Following the huge success of these activations, we hope to unify venue AV across more LED floors, banners, jumbotrons, lights and sound so they can be driven from a single system in the future.\u201d Disguise\u00a0and\u00a0ASB GlassFloor ASB GlassFloor tech enables coaches to visualize players\u2019 live positions, movement speed and performance metrics, directly on the playing surface, enabling teams to play more efficiently and win more games.\u00a0Disguise and GlassFloor\u2019s partnership will ensure frame-accurate UHD playback, low latency and stability, so that impressive graphics can be displayed on a massive scale.\u00a0The companies are also co-developing a suite of apps to offer fans AR games and interactive halftime experiences. Disguise\u2019s media server technology has already helped teams like the Portland Trail Blazers become the first NBA team to broadcast AR graphics from a handheld camera, and has been trusted to drive visual experiences across some of the most high-stakes stadiums and entertainment venues across the world. Combining Disguise\u2019s Emmy Award-winning platform with ASB GlassFloor\u2019s LED court technology and proprietary software enables improved real-time player and ball tracking, displaying live positions, movement and speed, so coaches can analyze performance and fans can become more immersed in the game. To support this goal, ASB GlassFloor and Disguise are co-developing a suite of applications built specifically to offer fans AR games and interactive halftime experiences they can enjoy from any part of the arena. These applications will also allow venues to use the floor for training, competition, fan engagement and non-game-day activations. From AI-assisted defenders in basketball coaching, to traffic safety applications for children and aiding larger, live TV productions on the weekends, the integrated platform aims to drive more traffic, impact, and utilization to existing arena infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0 Key features include multi-layered 8K video playback, animations that respond to gameplay,\u00a0real-time stats integration, player tracking and interactive games bring\u00a0live viewership to the next level, whilst being able to enhance\u00a0performance of professional teams and young players alike. \u201cThis partnership highlights a broader industry shift: sports venues are no longer static spaces used only on game day,\u201d says Senior Vice President of Commercial at Disguise, Jake Stone. \u201cTogether with ASB GlassFloor, we\u2019ll help teams not only improve their performance, but also increase their revenue by using their arena as an always-on, programmable environment that everyone can benefit from year-round, whether it\u2019s used for a brand product demo or a band\u2019s stadium tour. This is not just about changing how courts look or using LED floors as a novelty, but redefining how sports infrastructure is used for the future.\u201d Disguise Info Disguise is a global technology company driving the next dimension of entertainment.

        "full_text": "Sports  Techie TYPTI, a new racquet sport that just launched was invented by Steve Bellamy, Chairman and CEO of TYPTI Inc., and founder of the Tennis Channel. The easy to play racquet sport is played on a standard pickleball court which number in the thousands across North America. All ages and skill levels of players use a standardized 22-inch strung racquet, an innovative 3.5-inch diameter channeled foam ball, and a new scoring system. TYPTI has a slew of blue chip sports and entertainment investors. This launch features a growing national infrastructure in place, a national circuit, major partnerships, and committed top players to strategically and organically help grow the sport rapidly. \u201cWe\u2019re creating an infrastructure of tennis and pickleball clubs, entrepreneurs, family offices, racquet sport mavens and lovers, and cities who understand the economic impact of participatory sports,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cWe\u2019re sanctioning tournaments and league teams, and looking for brands wanting to leverage sports to market their products. We\u2019re also scouring the country for amazing players who can be the first generation of TYPTI stars. Basically, we\u2019re building a really smart racquet sport and creating a community for the infrastructure.\u201d TYPTI Specs TYPTI is financed by many strategic investors including\u00a0Tony Robbins,\u00a0Drew Brees,\u00a0Chris Pine,\u00a0JJ Abrams,\u00a0Bert Kreischer,\u00a0Tiffany Haddish,\u00a0Heather Mills,\u00a0Kyle MacLachlan,\u00a0Melissa Rivers,\u00a0Giovanni Ribisi,\u00a0Kenny Moore,\u00a0Jen Prince,\u00a0Nick Kyrgios,\u00a0Milos Raonic,\u00a0Prakash Amritraj,\u00a0JT Mollner,\u00a0Gil Henry, David Flaherty,\u00a0Desiree Gruber,\u00a0Andrew Segal,\u00a0Barry Allen\u00a0and\u00a0Tony Pritzker\u00a0to name but a sliver of the nearly 100 blue chip investors. With a novel mixture of badminton and tennis, the enticing sport is nearly noiseless compared to pickleball, and it is considered a low-impact sport that is easy on the body, with low shock at impact and no overhead serve that can be hard on shoulders. TYPTI has an easy learning curve for beginners yet offers chess like sophistication for the pros. The bottom line by design for Bellamy is it\u2019s young at heart appeal and that it\u2019s fun to play for all participants. If you haven\u2019t paid attention, pickleball courts are everyone across the nation. TYPTI launches to the public with professional, amateur, collegiate, and high school competitions, backed by tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure already in place for players to adopt and embrace the sport. The all-skill level national competitive play circuit will begin with the first event on February 25 at the Calabasas Pickleball Club. The professional division will guarantee over $100,000 in total prize money with at least $500,000 of prize money events in year one. Year-two events will have over $1,000,000 in prize money featuring an integrated draw allowing players from all over the US to participate locally to start. Anyone who has a pickleball court now has a TYPTI court. \u201cTYPTI reminds me of snowboarding in 1986,\u201d said\u00a0Tony Robbins, No. 1 New York Times best-selling author, and the world\u2018s No. 1 life and business strategist. \u201cSnowboarding exploded profits at ski resorts by adding a second use case to the mountain. That\u2019s what TYPTI will do for pickleball clubs and tennis clubs with pickleball. And the accessibility is unparalleled. While it\u2019s mind-blowing what the top players are doing with the ball, beginners can have great rallies in minutes. That\u2019s not typical for racquet sports, where the barriers of entry prevent the majority from using them as a tool for physical fitness. TYPTI blows the doors off those barriers and will be an unparalleled tool for physical fitness and mental health.\u201d The new sport has inked a number of important partnerships with collegiate, racquet and coaching organizations, including the Racquet Sports Professional Association with over 14,000 teaching pros. \u201cThe initial response to TYPTI is VERY positive,\u201d said\u00a0Brian Dillman, RSPA CEO. \u201cWe hosted an introduction to TYPTI in Hawaii and then had a webinar to talk in more detail and our members were captivated. The connection to tennis, additional utilization for pickleball courts, reduced noise and the organization\u2019s tenacity will entice many people to play. We have partnered with TYPTI and will be working to help market the sport and develop coaching models exclusive to RSPA members.\u201d There is also an agreement in place with the Intercollegiate Tennis Association to have a significant prize money collegiate championship. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for ways to enhance the lives of our student athletes,\u201d said\u00a0David Mullin, ITA CEO. \u201cTYPTI will be a very smart option for some collegiate tennis players as the mechanics of the two sports are so similar.\u201d Bellamy further explained, \u201cI\u2019ve spent my career helping racquet sports grow because they\u2019re a powerful gift to society. Our goal is not to cannibalize other racquet sports like tennis and pickleball, but instead bring the 25 million former players in the U.S. who don\u2019t play anymore back on the court. If they play TYPTI and then migrate to tennis, pickleball, badminton, table tennis or padel, then that will be a huge success for the entire industry.\u201d OLO brand racquets and balls are available at TYPTI.com with more brands coming shortly. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to announce the redevelopment of a TYPTI Prince Precision Mono,\u201d said Tim Puttock from Prince Tennis. \u201cWe love that they\u2019re being managed with product and excited to be there near the ground floor.\u201d\u00a0 Check out the TYPTI website Sports Techie, TYPTI offers a new scoring method that is said to uniquely marry risk and reward. It has a hard-working, networked and experienced founder, savvy investors, plenty of necessary infrastructure, unique rackets and balls, its own governing body, and both amateur and professional tours. It also has, \u2018show me the money\u2019 prizes if you are talented enough, already in place. What more can you ask for when launching a new sport. What it needs after the launch is high user adoption, homegrown star players, and an international, loyal fanbase that enjoys playing and watching both the tours and tournaments, while viewing live in person, via streaming and on TV, when that time arrives. I hear ESPN/ABC needs fresh content, contact Steve at the TYPTI before their media rights price tag goes way up.

        "full_text": "Sports  Techie High school basketball in Nebraska is home to Hurrdat Sports and now, NebPreps, a newly launched, analytical and computerized ratings solution. Software driven sport polls are common throughout college and pro sports; however, the prep landscape was noticeable bare of such a digital asset. Prep basketball in Nebraska debuted this Hurrdat Sports designed, comprehensive computer ratings system built to scale across high school athletics, a few weeks ago beginning with basketball. The Sports Techie community blog chatted with Mike Sautter, Reporter and Content Creator for NebPreps, about the need for such a sports technology product in 2026, how it compliments human complied coaches\u2019 polls, and what the future of the innovative creation looks like. Words like \u2018fact-based\u2019 and \u2018transparent\u2019 describe their cutting-edge ratings system that provides fans, coaches and the media with a powerful new tool updated on a weekly basis built to evaluate teams and rank them, across Class A, B, C-1, C-2, D-1 and D-2 throughout the season. \u201cHigh school sports fans deserve the same analytical tools that college and pro sports fans have had for years,\u201d Sautter said. \u201cThis fills a gap in Nebraska high school sports coverage with transparent, fact-based ratings that will spark conversation and give fans a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape.\u201d NebPreps Path NebPreps model evaluates teams across six key classifications based on game results, strength of schedule,\u00a0margin of victory and timing. The system was designed by data analyst, Jeff Swanson, @jeffgswanson, in about a months\u2019 time, to complement traditional coaches\u2019 polls while reducing subjective bias and identifying underrated programs. More and more decisions are data-driven so it\u2019s no surprise to see this trend extend into youth and high school sports. The novel concept was to use algorithms to reshaping evaluation systems beyond the pro level, from recruiting to playoff seeding. This new platform is now available to schools, sports fans, reporters and recruiters. NebPreps computer ratings for boys and girls basketball are available at https://hurrdatsports.com/nebpreps/computer-ratings/. Look for weekly updates published every Monday throughout the regular season with additional sports such as football, to be added in the near future. Why Computer Ratings Matter Computer ratings reduce subjective bias from the ranking process. While human editorial polls rely on perception, reputation and limited observations, the NebPreps computer ratings will evaluate every team based solely on what happens on a court, diamond or field. The result is a comprehensive assessment that: NebPreps, which provides comprehensive coverage, polls and awards for Nebraska high school sports, will continue to publish a weekly coaches poll to give fans both traditional and analytical perspectives. The computer ratings will provide an objective complement to human-driven polls, similar to models used in college sports. How the Ratings System Works The NebPreps computer ratings system is built on a points-based efficiency model that evaluates teams through these key dimensions: \u201cWe waited until week five of the high school basketball season to launch the rating system to allow for sufficient data collection,\u201d Sautter said. \u201cEarly-season ratings with limited game samples can be unreliable and volatile. By week five, basketball teams have typically played six to eight games, which provides enough information for meaningful initial assessments, while still leaving most of the season ahead.\u201d Ratings are recalculated after each week\u2019s games, so every result matters. A rating of 50 represents an average team in each class, while higher ratings indicate stronger teams. Limitations, Context The computer ratings have limitations: \u201cOur ratings are one lens through which to evaluate teams,\u201d Sautter said. \u201cWe encourage fans and analysts to consider ratings alongside traditional polls, expert opinions and their own observations. The best analysis combines multiple perspectives.\u201d Looking Ahead As the season progresses, the NebPreps computer ratings system will: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring this analytical dimension to Nebraska high school sports,\u201d Sautter said. \u201cWe encourage fans to follow NebPreps for weekly updates and join the conversation as we track the 2025-26 high school sports season through data-driven insights.\u201d Hurrdat Sports Hurrdat Sports offers spectators a new, engaging way to consume local sports media in Nebraska. Covering athletic events from Nebraska, Creighton, UNO and everything in between, Hurrdat Sports strives to generate podcasts, video and social media content that contains in-depth coverage, player perspectives and expertise that can\u2019t be found anywhere in the state. Follow Hurrdat Sports on social media at: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Media Contact: Kevin Schuster, 402-917-6001, kschuster@lukaspartners.com Sports Techie, I enjoyed speaking with Mike, he\u2019s a very easy going, well-spoken and down-home dude. After doing my due diligence on NebPreps and Hurrdat Sports, I can share the following with certainly. These people pump out relevant content like it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. They produce nonstop posts, videos and interviews about professional, collegiate and high school sports in Nebraska at an impressive pace. Because of this, the logical question to pose to Mike was whether he gets any sleep? He laughed, and acknowledged at times, not so much! A key point he emphasized several times was how the computer polls aim to become a compliment to human polls, one that keeps coaches poll value in place even though they tend to rank teams the same, week in and week out. The system offers a more comprehensive scope that looks at additional metrics, while attempting to remove bias. The new, data-driven model measures a variety of metrics such as all games, win and losses, margin of victory, opponent strength, home and away, and timing \u2013 meaning slightly more weight is given to later games in the schedule compared to early season matchup results. The model is programmed to be more stable 4 or 5 weeks into the hoops season which is about 8 games and after holiday tournaments. He believes it can also offer a better gauge in both divisions and classes. More data equals more accuracy resulting in a more improved method of identifying the best teams going forward. Predicting future performance using the software is an excellent guide for districts and state playoffs. An interesting data point to learn was that boys\u2019 rankings are gathering more traction than the girls. Because women and girl sports are soaring in popularity, I expect it might flip the other way because of the popularity of the WNBA and women\u2019s college basketball and across girls\u2019 high school and youth hoops. One product goal is to replace the wildcard points system used by the NSA for playoff seeding by complimenting it by using a deeper dive and more genuine perspective provided by NebPreps data. Mike also was consistent with sharing the system\u2019s limitations. A key metric such as all the daily injuries that occur are too much manual date entry work at this time, as are entering constantly changing weather factors like snow and wind, in addition to a variety of travel factors. With enough demand, adjustments can be made in time for the next football season making NebPreps more of a true metric measurement and ultimately, a new standard of high school athletics polls. Mike has never seen a media entity such as NebPreps and he has covered high school sports in Nebraska for 15 years. As far as he knows, other states do not offer anything like it. Jeff is a developer and took about a month to design, program and roll out the platform back in August. Mike mentioned their internal tools are a key feature, it has data not currently available to the public yet. He found the lists to be \u2018amazing\u2019 and likes the ability to search the data using a drop-down menu that uncovers more statistics. I asked couple more questions. First, is it available to purchase? Mike mentioned.  \u201cThe backend is done but the computer rankings system needs to be finetuned before selling through to other states. It is not currently available for purchase.\u201d Where he sees a good immediate fit is as a replacement for a wild card playoff determination. I asked whether a product sponsor was a consideration. He said, \u201cPerhaps, as it (NebPreps) draws more attention, we will look at the numbers, it is only 2 weeks (now 3 weeks) into it. Thus far it is pretty good from an engagement side, it is a wait and see before we run the numbers. The interaction on social media, especially Instagram, has been a positive, with several comments liking the computer rankings over the coach\u2019s poll.\u201d One reason for this is NebPreps can identify teams that fly under the radar better than the coach\u2019s poll. A team can be ninth in the subjective rating but second in the computer rankings. Sautter also mentioned one of the main reasons to create NebPreps was to increase engagement and thus far, it seems to be working, especially on Instagram. Often times engagement comes with negative comments. I wondered how they plan to handle posted complaints about topics like improper ratings or the criteria and resulting metrics. Sautter understood my thought and shared, \u201cHurrdat Sports celebrates the story differently, we celebrate athletes and teams, emphasizing positivity, in a unique way.\u201d \u00a0 I voiced a concern about the margin of victory metric. Once coaches understood the system, what prevents schools from running up scores, too often in an unsportsmanlike way, to manipulate the algorithms for better rankings. Mike said, \u201cVictory margin is a play on college basketball and net ratings.\u201d He explained that they hadn\u2019t round tabled this thought but felt it was not something of immediate concern. NebPreps is shared on Mondays, this week will be the third poll release. \u00a0Their Nebraska coaches\u2019 poll is released on Sundays, and Mike believes that together with the computer ranking, this unique combination can drive engagement and discussions. My son and I drove from Georgia to Idaho two summer ago including driving all the way through Nebraska. It is cool to put this story about NebPreps next to memories of driving through the state with family, going to see more family, as a means of understanding the ratings, pride and growth of prep sports throughout the state. My gratitude goes out to NebPreps, Hurrdat Sports and to Mike, for sharing this sports tech story. Computerized high school ratings may soon be available in your state.

If you haven\u2019t hopped on the softball hype train already, it\u2019s about time you do so. Four of the eight teams from last year\u2019s edition of the WCWS \u2014 Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, UCLA and Arizona \u2014 return to Oklahoma City this year, and four others round out the field for what should be a fantastic week of softball.\u00a0 Here are the players from each team that you need to know before the games begin:\u00a0 UCLA: Delanie Wisz, C/3B\u00a0 The Bruins are making their Division I-record 34th appearance at the Women\u2019s College World Series after an undefeated run through the regional and super-regional rounds, and Wisz has been a huge part of that. She is one of several fifth-year seniors on UCLA\u2019s roster coming into OKC with ample postseason experience, though she wasn't on the team for the championship run in 2019; Wisz played two years at Loyola Marymount before transferring to UCLA for the 2020 season.\u00a0 Her defensive versatility is awfully valuable on its own, but she has also had a career year at the plate, hitting .407 with 14 home runs as UCLA\u2019s primary three-hole hitter. Look for her to continue to shine in the middle of the Bruins\u2019 lineup as they go for their 14th national championship.\u00a0 Other players to watch: SS Briana Perez (1.188 OPS), CF Maya Brady (13 HRs; Tom Brady\u2019s niece), SP Megan Faraimo (1.70 ERA), SP Holly Azevedo (1.19 ERA)\u00a0 Texas: Hailey Dolcini, SP The Longhorns return to the WCWS for the first time since 2013, and it\u2019s safe to say they couldn\u2019t have done it without Dolcini, who has had quite the journey over her collegiate career and now gets the chance to show off her ability on the game\u2019s biggest stage. A California native, Dolcini played her freshman season at UC-Riverside before transferring to Fresno State, where she became an All-American pitcher and dominated in the Mountain West Conference.\u00a0 With the additional year of eligibility granted to all players following the canceled 2020 season, Dolcini decided to take another step up in competition and transfer to Texas. She immediately stepped in as the ace for the Longhorns, posting a 2.19 ERA in 195 innings. Most notably, she threw a complete game against mighty Oklahoma to end the Sooners' 40-game winning streak and hand OU one of only two losses of the season back on April 16, so you know she won\u2019t be intimidated should Texas face Oklahoma again at some point in OKC. Other players to watch: 2B Janae Jefferson (1.151 OPS), C Mary Iakopo (10 HRs), SP Sophia Simpson (102 Ks in 83 IP) Oklahoma: Grace Lyon, SS As the defending champions and heavy favorites entering this weekend, the Sooners have such an overwhelming amount of talent that it becomes difficult to highlight just one player. The objectively correct player to focus on is still slugger Jocelyn Alo, the all-time home run queen who is looking to cap off her spectacular career with another national title. Or you could look to dazzling freshman Jordy Bahl, who has posted a ridiculous 0.95 ERA with 199 strikeouts in 132.1 IP, though she has dealt in recent weeks with injuries that leave her status for the WCWS somewhat questionable.\u00a0 Lyons, though, has stepped up in a huge way this season. Already regarded as one of the best defensive shortstops in the country, Lyons took a big step forward on offense in 2022, as she launched a career-high 21 HRs and drove in 62 runs, third on the team behind only Alo and sophomore sensation (and double-play partner) Tiare Jennings. Lyons has always been one of the best players in the country, but her excellence has been somewhat obscured by all the star power on the Sooners' roster. In her senior year, Lyons is finally getting the love she deserves, and she'll surely be a crucial factor if Oklahoma is to repeat as champion.\u00a0 Other players to watch: Alo (29 HRs, 1.797 OPS), Bahl (0.95 ERA in 132.1 IP), SP Hope Trautwein (0.40 ERA in 104.1 IP), CF Jayda Coleman (1.249 OPS), 2B Tiare Jennings (24 HRs) Northwestern: Danielle Williams, SP Easily one of the most fun parts of softball is that ace starting pitchers throw a much higher percentage of innings for their teams than any baseball pitchers could ever dream of \u2014 or at least, any baseball pitchers in the past 100 years. Williams is this year\u2019s premier example of a starting pitcher who has completely put her team on her back down the stretch, as she has pitched a staggering 91.5% of the Wildcats\u2019 innings this postseason.\u00a0 That includes an unbelievable 430 pitches over the three-game super-regional last weekend against Arizona State, and the senior left-hander does it all with an infectious smile on her face. She\u2019s a delight to watch and a tremendous talent for an exciting Northwestern program making its first trip to the WCWS since 2007. Other players to watch: OF Rachel Lewis (22 HRs), C Jordyn Rudd (.375 BA), SS Maeve Nelson (12 HRs) Florida: Skylar Wallace, SS Incredibly, this will be the first WCWS since 2007 without multiple representatives from the SEC, as the Gators were the conference's only team to make it to OKC after a slew of upsets in the first two rounds, including hosts Alabama, Missouri and Tennessee all losing in regionals and Arkansas and Mississippi State being eliminated in super-regionals. Florida, meanwhile, prevailed despite dropping Game 1 in the best-of-three against No. 3 Virginia Tech.\u00a0 The Gators are led on offense by Wallace, who is in her first season with Florida after transferring from conference rival Alabama and sitting out the 2021 season. While the Gators don\u2019t have the same level of power (just 37 HRs in 65 games) as some of the other teams in OKC, they outpace the field in another category: stolen bases. Florida\u2019s 131 steals are tied for fourth in Division I and rank first among WCWS teams by a mile (Texas is next with 92); 51 of those belong to Wallace, tied for second-most in Division I. Wallace also leads the team in extra-bases hits, with 25, so she is not merely a speedster but an all-around star.\u00a0 Other players to watch: CF Kendra Falby (.962 OPS, 36 stolen bases), 2B Hannah Adams (.969 OPS), 3B Charla Echols (19 XBH), SP Elizabeth Hightower (2.44 ERA in 163.2 IP) Oregon State: Mariah Mazon, two-way player Mazon has racked up some truly eye-popping numbers in the circle over her five-year career with the Beavers: a 2.21 ERA with 861 strikeouts in 866 (!!!) innings pitched.\u00a0And this year, she also leveled up on offense in a significant way. She didn\u2019t hit much in her first two years in Corvallis, but she started getting regular at-bats in 2020 and is capping off her career in impressive fashion: by hitting .366 with 12 HRs this season when she wasn\u2019t busy being the Beavers\u2019 ace. \u00a0 With the team making its first trip to the WCWS since 2006, this is a tremendous opportunity for the Beavers. They were below .500 just last season, and there\u2019s no one better to lead the way than the veteran Mazon. Other players to watch: 1B Frankie Hammoude (15 HRs), 2B Kiki Escobar (.343 BA), SP Sarah Haendiges (1.97 ERA in 137 IP) Oklahoma State: Chyenne Factor, CF The Cowgirls return to OKC for the 14th time, though they also have the unfortunate distinction of being the program with the most trips to the WCWS without winning a title. They should have an excellent chance to change that this season, thanks to an elite pitching staff led by Kelly Maxwell. But here I\u2019ll highlight Factor, who has been a force on both sides of the ball during her career in Stillwater and has continued to excel in her senior campaign, including a homer earlier this season off National Player of the Year candidate Georgina Corrick. Another fun Factor fact: Her brother, Cross, who played briefly at Oklahoma State in 2019, led NAIA in batting average this year, with a stunning .525 mark, and he finished second nationally in home runs with 30 for the Oklahoma City University Stars.\u00a0 Other players to watch: OF Katelynn Carwile (.353 BA), two-way player Miranda Elish (2.09 ERA in 104 IP; 1.062 OPS), 3B Sydney Pennington (10 HR), SP Kelly Maxwell (1.16 ERA in 169 IP) Arizona: Carlie Scupin, 1B With the retirement of legendary head coach Mike Candrea after the 2021 season, all eyes were on his replacement \u2014 former Wildcat player Caitlin Lowe \u2014 to see if this historic program could continue to thrive. Sure enough, they\u2019re right back in Oklahoma City for the 29th time, most of any Division I program not called UCLA.\u00a0 There are plenty of sluggers worth spotlighting for an Arizona team that hit 95 home runs, which ranked ninth in Division I and trails only Oklahoma among teams in the WCWS field. Scupin (19 HRs) has been one of the biggest power threats for the Wildcats in 2022, and her crouched stance and uppercut swing are especially entertaining. Still just a sophomore, she might be only scratching the surface of her potential. Other players to watch: C Sharlize Palacios (19 HRs), 2B Allie Skaggs (24 HRs), SP Hanah Bowen (3.67 ERA in 129.2 IP) Jordan Shusterman is half of @CespedesBBQ and a baseball writer for FOX Sports.

Richardson, somewhat shockingly, finished last with a time of 11.14. Saturday's result comes just weeks after Thompson-Herah broke Joyner's 100-meter Olympic record of 10.62 by posting a 10.61 en route to winning gold in Tokyo.\u00a0 Still, there was some thought that if Richardson had raced in Tokyo \u2013 she was suspended due to a marijuana violation \u2013 maybe she could have challenged Thompson-Herah, considering Richardson's 10.72 in April of this year is the sixth-fastest 100m time in women's history.\u00a0 And Richardson had the powerful backing that made Saturday's race all the more intriguing.\u00a0 First, Kanye West showed his support.\u00a0 Then, Nike added its own. Any speculation as to who is the fastest woman on Earth ended on Saturday, at least until the two take the track again.\u00a0 As always, Twitter had something to say. Here's social media's reaction to Saturday's surprising result, including that of Emmanuel Acho from \"Speak For Yourself\": As for Richardson, she spoke on the track after the race and warned doubters about counting her out because of Saturday's underwhelming performance.\u00a0 The silver lining in all of this? Richardson turned 21 in March.\u00a0 Time is on her side, even if Twitter is not.",

        "full_text": "POPULAR SEARCHES\n           \n            BROWSE BY\n           July 4 is about celebrating Independence Day, enjoying time with family, watching some fireworks and perhaps eating a hot dog \u2026 or 70. Well, maybe not 70 for most people. But if you were paying any attention to the Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest on Sunday, you got to watch a few folks at least make the attempt. As has become tradition, Joey Chestnut once again dominated the event, stuffing 76 hot dogs into his face in 10 minutes to break the world record he set just last year. Chestnut, 37, has won the event five straight times and 14 of the past 15. On the women's side, Michelle Lesco won the belt by downing just shy of 31 dogs in 10 minutes. Miki Sudo, who set the women's record at 48.5 last year, would have been favored to win the event, but she opted to work out of the ESPN booth this year during her pregnancy. Here are some other things to know about the competition, a sanctioned celebration of gluttony that has become an American tradition. Why does this exist? Humans are competitive creatures and love to eat, so it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that competitive eating is a thing around the world or that professional eaters compete in contests and are governed by such outfits as Major League Eating. Right? Nathan\u2019s is a hot dog eating contest, but there are also competitions centered on other foods, including hamburgers, pies, pancakes, wings, pizza and ribs. Apparently, eating contests date back at least as far as the 13th century and the first recorded pie-eating contest took place in Toronto in 1878. According to Nathan's, the origins of the hot dog eating contest date to July 4, 1916, when four immigrants decided that would be the best way to determine which of them was the most patriotic. How does the Nathan\u2019s contest work? It\u2019s pretty simple. Competitors have 10 minutes to eat as many hot dogs (including buns) as they can. They have to be members of MLE and must qualify for Nathan\u2019s through various regional events. The contestants can consume the dogs and buns separately and are allowed to dunk the buns in water, but they can be penalized for \"messy eating\" and disqualified if they \u2013 ahem \u2013 lose their lunch. The winners earn $10,000 and the \"Mustard Belt.\" Anything else? If you thought you had a bad post-BBQ stomachache today, imagine how Chestnut must feel.",

The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom. The bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won\u2019t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude. Another commercial features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles. The Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI\u2019s users, after that company\u2019s recent announcement that ads will be coming to ChatGPT\u2019s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic \u201cmocks,\u201d \u201cskewers,\u201d and \u201cdunks on\u201d OpenAI. They are funny enough that even Sam Altman admitted on X that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn\u2019t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian.\u201d First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won\u2019t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic\u2026 In that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin. But the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were \u201cdishonest\u201d in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).\u201dWe would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,\u201d Altman wrote in the social media post. \u201cWe are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.\u201d Indeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific \u2014 which is the central allegation of Anthropic\u2019s ads. As OpenAI explained on its blog, \u201cWe plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there\u2019s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.\u201d Altman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. \u201cAnthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can\u2019t pay for subscriptions.\u201d But Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, and $200. ChatGPT\u2019s tiers are $0, $8, $20, and $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent. Altman also alleged in his post that \u201cAnthropic wants to control what people do with AI.\u201d He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from \u201ccompanies they don\u2019t like,\u201d like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can\u2019t use AI for. True, Anthropic\u2019s whole marketing deal since day one has been \u201cresponsible AI.\u201d The company was founded by two former OpenAI alums, after all, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there. Still, both chatbot companies have usage policies, AI guardrails, and talk about AI safety. And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to be used for erotica while Anthropic does not, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that some content should be blocked, particularly in regards to mental health. Yet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being \u201cauthoritarian.\u201d \u201cOne authoritarian company won\u2019t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,\u201d he wrote. Using \u201cauthoritarian\u201d in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It\u2019s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which protesters around the world have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve. Topics \nVenture Editor\n Tickets are live at the lowest rates of the year.

The company\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy. In Q4, Snap\u2019s revenue was $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company\u2019s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows. The company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform launched back in 2022. The service\u2019s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million. While those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter \u2014 dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world. Reuters also reports that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts\u2019 previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings. During Wednesday\u2019s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company\u2019s newer offerings, including its recent effort to charge users for Memories storage \u2014 a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps \u2014 and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses. \u201cOur long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,\u201d said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a \u201cstrong standalone brand\u201d for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal \u201cto a different audience segment\u201d than the \u201ccore Snapchat audience.\u201d That said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: \u201cWe\u2019re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.\u201d Topics \nSenior Writer, TechCrunch\n Tickets are live at the lowest rates of the year.

But new funds are being raised to fill this gap, and Spain-based Mundi Ventures\u2019 latest fund, Kembara Fund I, is one of them. After securing a \u20ac350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund under the European Tech Champions Initiative in 2024, Mundi Ventures has just completed a \u20ac750 million first close for Kembara, its fifth fund and largest to date.\u00a0 Regulatory filing from Spain reveals that the fund \u2014 focused on deep tech \u2014 could even stretch its final closing to \u20ac1.25 billion. But according to Kembara co-founder and general partner Yann de Vries, getting to \u20ac750 million in two years as a first fund in this environment \u201cwas not easy.\u201d Kembara is managed by a specialist team within Mundi Ventures, with offices in Madrid, London, Barcelona, and Paris. Mundi Ventures founder Javier Santiso is now also a co-founder and GP of the Kembara fund, which has now disclosed the full list of its senior partners. Alongside de Vries and Santiso, climate tech VC Robert Trezona and deep tech VC Pierre Festal have also joined as general partners, as well as former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as senior strategic advisor. (Pictured from left to right: Javier Santiso, Siraj Khaliq, Robert Trezona, Yann de Vries and Pierre Festal.) Their individual track records helped them raise funds from institutional backers waking up to the need for European growth capital that can turn its many university spinouts into sizable businesses with industrial synergies. But it also gave them a front-row seat into the broader growing pains of European climate and deep tech startups \u2014 especially de Vries.\u00a0 A seasoned venture capitalist who founded Redpoint eVentures Brazil and later became a partner at Atomico, de Vries had moved to the other side of the table to join German electric aircraft startup Lilium \u2014 only for the company to cease operations in 2024 after raising more than $1 billion and going public via a SPAC.\u00a0 In de Vries\u2019 view, Lilium went bankrupt because it couldn\u2019t find the growth capital it needed, but this \u201ctraumatizing experience\u201d also had a silver lining. \u201cI saw so many amazing teams in Europe that were going through the same journey,\u201d he said. \u201c[Europe] doesn\u2019t have an innovation problem. It doesn\u2019t have a startup problem. The problem it has is a scale-up problem.\u201d Kembara\u2019s sweet spot will be Series B and C rounds, with plans to write initial checks from \u20ac15 million to \u20ac40 million into some 20 companies. But the fund\u2019s size leaves room for follow-ons to help portfolio startups scale manufacturing and expand globally, and total investments could go up to \u20ac100 million per company.\u00a0 That\u2019s more than the full size of many European funds, though this may be changing: deep tech VC firm Elaia and asset manager Lazard teamed up to form LEC (Lazard Elaia Capital), whose initial investments will range between \u20ac20 million and \u20ac60 million per company, while operator-led fund Plural is reportedly raising a new fund of up to \u20ac1 billion. Still, the capital-intensive nature of most climate and deep tech growth-stage companies means that even large VC checks can only go so far. One lesson de Vries learned from Lilium is that raising only in equity is very hard, and even puts companies in a hard spot later on. This inspired Kembara to take a different approach to financing. \u201cSeveral of us have lived through this, and what we want to do now is to productize non-dilutive financing for these deep tech founders to help them de-risk their future financing and optimize the capital structure to minimize dilution. And we\u2019re bringing in [limited partners] who [\u2026] not only want to invest in the fund, but also want to coinvest in those winners,\u201d de Vries said.\u00a0 For these LPs, geopolitics also plays a role in wanting to provide growth capital and venture debt to European growth-stage startups. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of support from sovereign wealth funds in Europe, from government, from corporations, to push and drive for building these European champions in deep tech out of Europe,\u201d de Vries predicted.\u00a0 These geopolitical undertones are also reflected in Kembara\u2019s sector focus, which includes dual use and defense tech to \u201cprotect European sovereignty,\u201d according to a press release. However, de Vries pushed back against the idea that Kembara is simply replacing capital that later-stage European outfits could have raised abroad.\u00a0 \u201cThere are lots of gems that are under the radar in Europe, that could be scaling into global champions, and that are not realizing their full potential.\u201d He said DeepMind is a related example, \u201cwhere they were missing this growth capital and sold too early.\u201d (Google acquired the company for more than $500 million in 2014, but it is now estimated to be worth billions.) Keeping European companies European has gained urgency in many verticals that overlap with Kembara\u2019s thesis, such as quantum computing, semiconductors, and space tech. But its goal is to foster global champions that cross borders. Coincidentally, Kembara means \u201cto wander\u201d in Malaysian (although the team holds \u201cthe humble path to excellence\u201d as an older meaning). Beyond the name, Kembara has Malaysian connections. Santiso is also the former CEO for Europe of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah; and doors could open as many countries examine their exposure to the U.S. \u201cIn the second close, we\u2019re going to be looking for global investors, because we want to have global access to markets, but also global access to supply chain,\u201d de Vries said.

With former employees who went on to create dozens of startups, the fintech company has become one of the most prolific \u201cfounder factories\u201d \u2014 and the money is following. The latest example: business identity verification startup Duna, which just raised a \u20ac30 million Series A to become the best-funded European member of the so-called \u201cStripe mafia.\u201d The funding round was led by Alphabet\u2019s growth fund CapitalG, which has also backed Stripe since co-leading its Series D in 2016. Based in Germany and the Netherlands, Duna was co-founded by Stripe alumni Duco van Lanschot and David Schreiber. With customers including Plaid, the startup helps fintech companies onboard business customers more efficiently, reducing the typical churn associated with corporate ID checks and other fraud prevention measures. Stripe is not a customer of Duna, van Lanschot said, but its executives were well placed to understand the opportunity that the startup is seizing, which is reflected in its cap table. The company\u2019s angel investors include former Stripe executives David Singleton (CTO), Claire Hughes Johnson (COO) and Michael Cocoman (Global Chief Compliance Officer). Even Stripe rival Adyen got involved, with CRCO Mari\u00ebtte Swart and CFO Ethan Tandowsky joining as angels. Their endorsements also validate van Lanschot\u2019s hunch that these companies won\u2019t compete with Duna, even though they could. \u201cIt requires such fine-grained controls that change on a company-by-company basis, that an Adyen or a Stripe isn\u2019t going to spin out their business onboarding as a separate product where another enterprise customer can change all of the configurations,\u201d he told TechCrunch. If it\u2019s still worth the effort for Duna, it\u2019s because the startup is going after the long tail of enterprise clients that don\u2019t have huge resources to dedicate to business onboarding. But it\u2019s also because its vision doesn\u2019t stop there: Duna\u2019s ambition is to build a network that allows companies to reuse their verified identity information across multiple platforms. \u201cWhat we want to build over time is a global trust infrastructure where we provide a digital passport for every business. So you can reuse your file from onboarding on [German spend management platform] Moss to onboard with Plaid, or you can reuse it to open up a bank account,\u201d van Lanschot said.\u00a0 This goal resonated with Alex Nichols, the general partner who led CapitalG\u2019s investment into the Series A. \u201cI would say the common thing I look for in my investments are some sort of network effects, or more formal scale advantage,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI also love it when founders have an earned insight about a problem they may not know about otherwise, and this is a very good example of that,\u201d he added. Duna has competitors in the category known as KYB, or Know Your Business. This includes vendors such as Jumio and Veriff. But for Nichols, what sets Duna apart is its decision to generate its own data, rather than trying to aggregate existing data sources that are often lacking. \u201cIt\u2019s the rare opportunity to rebuild something as foundational as a Visa and create an amazing business in the process.\u201d Duna says it has already found a strong business case in helping customers onboard corporate users faster and cheaper. This also explains why existing investors are doubling down: Index Ventures, which led Duna\u2019s \u20ac10.7 million seed round in May 2025, participated in the Series A, as did Puzzle Ventures and Snowflake chairman Frank Slootman. But the startup\u2019s bigger ambition won\u2019t pay off until Duna reaches significant scale. So the company is looking for shortcuts. How so? Van Lanschot and the Duna team are identifying small clusters of companies that already overlap with each other \u2014 what they call \u201cpatches of networks.\u201d These include manufacturing companies with shared customers, investment firms with overlapping LPs, or companies in the same small country. In these tight-knit groups, the ability to reuse verification becomes valuable immediately, even before Duna achieves full network effects. The countries may be small, but the opportunity is big, van Lanschot said. \u201cIn the Netherlands alone \u2014 a tiny, tiny country \u2014 the four biggest banks employ 14,000 people in compliance, and half of them are working on businesses.\u201d CapitalG later clarified that 13,000 people work on compliance across all Dutch banks. Either way, Duna won\u2019t fully replace these jobs yet, but AI automation can save costs and generate revenue even before the network effects kick in. If Duna eventually provides the rails for an identity network, there might be an even bigger opportunity in taking advantage of this position to enable one-click business onboarding. This would make it akin to Amazon\u2019s one-click checkout \u2014 or closer to B2B, to Stripe Link. Once again with Duna, the Stripe connection is never really far. This story was updated to correct the name and title of one of Duna\u2019s angel investors, and to add a clarification on the number of people employed in compliance in the Netherlands.

Instead of responding to an analyst\u2019s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored. That decision tells us something, though \u2014 Alphabet isn\u2019t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI.  Over the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies\u2019 search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker $20 billion to be the default search engine on Apple devices, filings from the Department of Justice\u2019s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple\u2019s massive customer base \u2014 the iPhone maker last quarter announced it has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale. The latest Apple AI deal is rumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn\u2019t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers\u2019 websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google\u2019s search business, are still an \u201cexperiment\u201d for now. The company first announced last May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads\u2019 placement below or integrated into the chatbot\u2019s responses. Google is also trying out agentic shopping, including Shop with AI Mode, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface.  Meanwhile, Google\u2019s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI with its forthcoming Super Bowl ad, which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google. How this will all play out longer-term is still an open question \u2014 and for today, an unanswered one, apparently.  Overall, the Apple Siri deal barely received any mention during Alphabet\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday. Sundar Pichai only noted he was pleased that Apple\u2019s \u201cpreferred cloud provider\u201d and would be helping to develop \u201cthe next generation of Apple foundation models based on Gemini technology.\u201d Google\u2019s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler used the exact same wording when mentioning Apple, as well.

        "summary_rss": "Huawei\u2019s and Xiaomi\u2019s flagship devices are packed with impressive features, but Apple is dominating the Chinese smartphone market again\u2014for now.",
        "full_text": "After a prolonged slump, Apple\u2019s business is suddenly thriving again in China. The tech giant said in its latest earnings report last week that revenue from the country rose 38 percent year over year in the last quarter, primarily driven by surging demand for iPhones. The rebound came after Apple\u2019s China sales had declined for 18 consecutive months between 2024 and early 2025. In a call with analysts, CEO Tim Cook said Apple set a new record for iPhone upgrades among Chinese customers and saw double-digit growth in the number of users switching from other operating systems to iOS. \u201cOverall, a great quarter in China. We could not be happier with it,\u201d Cook concluded in his signature monotone voice. Apple\u2019s fantastic performance came as a surprise to many observers of the Chinese smartphone market. In recent years, homegrown brands like Huawei and Xiaomi have chipped away at Apple\u2019s market share by releasing premium, feature-packed devices that directly compete with the iPhone. Huawei, for instance, stunned the tech industry when it released a $2,800 smartphone with a trifold screen in September 2024, long before competitors put out similar products. The most striking thing about Apple\u2019s comeback in China is how it pulled it off. Instead of trying to compete by developing flashier tech, it simply released a new iPhone that is both powerful and competitively priced, experts tell WIRED. Even though there are devices from local brands that technically have better cameras and more sophisticated artificial intelligence capabilities (Apple Intelligence is not yet available in mainland China), many buyers still opted for Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 line. That suggests Chinese consumers continue to care more about Apple's brand power and design features than marginal technical improvements. \u201cIt's a good story if you're Apple. It's the same old story if you're not Apple,\u201d says Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst covering Apple at Counterpoint, a global technology research firm. Apple owes much of its success in China last quarter to sales of the baseline iPhone 17 model. Traditionally, consumers who buy iPhones at launch tend to gravitate toward the higher-end Pro and Pro Max devices But in 2025, the baseline iPhone 17 represented a much bigger step up from the iPhone 16 than usual, including features traditionally only associated with the Pro series. That may have motivated more people to upgrade sooner than usual after the new phones came out, Schneemann says. But Apple\u2019s product strategy wasn\u2019t the only important factor here. The iPhone 17 was priced low enough to qualify for a massive electronics subsidy program launched by the Chinese government last year. To help stimulate the economy, Beijing spent some $43 billion subsidizing domestic purchases of electronics, appliances, and cars in 2025. Smartphones sold for less than 6,000 RMB (about $860) were eligible for up to a 15 percent discount. Apple listed the iPhone 17 in China for 5,999 RMB, ensuring price-sensitive buyers would be able to benefit from the government policy. The state subsidy also arrived at a moment when many Chinese iPhone users were likely due for an upgrade anyway. \u201cApple\u2019s last peak sales period came with the iPhone 13 series, and after a span of three to four years, its existing users have gradually entered the upgrade cycle this year,\u201d says Arthur Guo, a Beijing-based research manager at IDC, a global market analysis firm. None of these explanations indicate that Apple\u2019s Chinese competitors are doing anything wrong. Guo notes that domestic brands have also experienced significant growth recently. Expensive flagship models from brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo have \u201cremained strong across the board\u2014with even more notable growth recorded for the higher-priced Pro/Pro Max variants,\u201d Guo says. The only exception is Huawei, which lost out on sales during much of the last quarter after releasing its flagship phone later than usual, at the end of November. Initial supply shortages also limited availability of the device. Huawei is Apple\u2019s most formidable competitor in the high-end Chinese market, and its absence almost certainly contributed to Apple\u2019s win. Apple\u2019s growth in China mirrors its success in other parts of the world. The company\u2019s share of the US smartphone market rose to 69 percent last quarter, a record high, according to a market analysis published by Counterpoint on Monday. As the smartphone industry heads into a potentially tumultuous period caused by a shortage of memory chips, Apple is setting itself up for a smoother 2026 than its rivals. Apple\u2019s recent track record in China offers a bitter lesson for Chinese competitors: Despite all the rhetoric about supporting domestic brands and their increasingly impressive phone models, Chinese shoppers are sticking with Apple. The Chinese tech giants may have folding phones and fancy AI, but all it took for Apple to regain its momentum was to upgrade the iPhone's screen display and make some other relatively small tweaks. \u201cI'm not too sure how somebody like Oppo or Vivo or Xiaomi can break that kind of stranglehold,\u201d says Schneemann.",

        "full_text": "An insurrectionist robot unleashed by a mad inventor in Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis. HAL 9000 sabotaging a manned mission to Jupiter in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Skynet, the self-aware global defense network that seeks to exterminate humanity throughout the Terminator franchise. Hollywood has never wanted for audacious depictions of artificial intelligence or the ways in which it could alter the fate of our species. But the rapid integration of AI into the studio system and our now unavoidable interactions with it have severely compromised the genre, not to mention film as a medium. On the one hand, it\u2019s perfectly understandable that screenwriters and studios would return to the subject of AI in recent years, particularly since it provokes such fierce debate within the industry. (A major cause of the 2023 labor strikes was the threat that AI posed to creative jobs.) Still, the novelty faded fast. Consider M3GAN, a campy horror flick about an artificially intelligent doll who starts killing people, released just a week after the debut of ChatGPT in 2022: It was a surprise box-office smash. Last year\u2019s sequel? A critical and commercial flop. Mission: Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning (2023) introduced a rogue AI called The Entity as a final adversary for Ethan Hunt and crew. The resolution of its cliff-hanger ending and blockbuster finale for the spy saga, Mission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning (2025), underperformed its predecessor, and neither quite justified their expense. The latest AI-themed bomb is Mercy, a crime thriller starring Chris Pratt as an LAPD detective strapped into a chair who has 90 minutes to pull enough evidence from security cameras and phone records to convince a stern judge bot (Rebecca Ferguson) that he didn\u2019t kill his wife\u2014or else face instant execution. Despite releasing in January, one reviewer has already declared it \u201cthe worst movie of 2026,\u201d and judging by its mediocre ticket sales, many US moviegoers decided as much from the trailer alone. It\u2019s almost as if nobody cared whether a fictional software program might be capable of sparing a life when real health insurance claims are being denied by algorithms already. For those few who did see it, Mercy fell far short of its dystopian premise, failing to grapple with the ethics of such a surveillance state and its medieval-modern justice system in favor of cheap relativism. Spoiler: Pratt\u2019s character and the AI ultimately team up to stop the real bad guys as the bot begins to show signs of unrobotic emotion and doubt, which manifest as glitches in the program. By the end, Pratt is delivering a true groaner of a we\u2019re-not-so-different speech to the holographic Ferguson. \u201cHuman or AI, we all make mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we learn.\u201d While the naive belief in AI\u2019s progress toward enlightenment feels dated on arrival, you are also reminded of how prophetically cynical something like Paul Verhoeven\u2019s RoboCop, now almost 40 years old, was in addressing a future of cybernetic fascism. Contrary to that kind of pitch-black, violent satire, the current trend seems to be propagandistic narratives about how AIs are scary at first but secretly good. (See also: Tron: Ares, Disney\u2019s wildly misguided attempt to leverage an old IP for the era of large language models, another cinematic train wreck of 2025.) In fact, the insistence on some inborn value or honor to artificial intelligence may be the driving force behind the new Time Studios web series On This Day\u20261776. Conceived as a blow-by-blow account of the year the American colonies declared independence from the British crown, it consists of short YouTube videos generated in part by Google DeepMind (though actual actors supply voiceovers). The project has drawn serious attention and scorn because acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky served as executive producer via his creative studio Primordial Soup, launched last year in a partnership with Google to explore the applications of AI in filmmaking. It probably doesn\u2019t help that Aronofsky and company are valorizing the country\u2019s founders in the same aesthetic that has defined the authoritarian meme culture of Donald Trump\u2019s second term. The YouTube replies are, to put it lightly, brutal. \u201cIf I was a professional director and I released this I would be suicidal,\u201d reads a top-voted comment on the first installment. \u201cPure dogshit,\u201d another person observed. Time Studios limited engagement to channel subscribers only; some commenters claimed they had subscribed simply to condemn the \u201cslop\u201d they were looking at. In addition to the uncanny faces and dead glossy eyes of the founding fathers, viewers noted constant quick cuts, presumably meant to limit visual errors. Yet, when called upon to render a historic document for a scene, DeepMind rendered the word \u201cAmerica\u201d as \u201cAamereedd.\u201d Audiences have proven equally hostile to digitally altered versions of existing entertainment. On social media, at least, you won\u2019t find many defenders of a certain nostalgia-baiting Xfinity commercial directed by Taika Waititi and scheduled to air during the Super Bowl this weekend. That\u2019s because it creepily de-ages Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum, all for a sequence of gags about the dinosaur zoo-resort functioning perfectly thanks to a solid Wi-Fi signal. In the grotesque close-ups, they\u2019re barely recognizable. The irony of appropriating a film that was technologically astounding for its time and adding a layer of ugly deepfakery is hard to miss. The ad was also made possible through extreme media and telecom consolidation, as Xfinity is a division of the multinational conglomerate Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, which owns Jurassic Park as well as NBC, which is broadcasting the Super Bowl. The result is a necrotic ode to brand synergy. Wisely, Xfinity has not allowed any comments whatsoever on the YouTube upload of the commercial, though the reactions elsewhere have not been enthusiastic. \u201cThat \u2018de-aging\u2019 technology just makes them look like melting wax figures,\u201d wrote a horrified user on X, where breathless hype for visual effects achieved with generative AI is usually plentiful. The entertainment world can\u2019t move as quickly as Silicon Valley startups or the public perception of smart appliances and virtual assistants. Nevertheless, Hollywood could soon notice an AI backlash that hurts its bottom line so long as studios are pushing it as both a half-baked dramatic theme and a transformative tool. However topical movies and television may become, they have long relied on the power of escapism. Will they have answers when we\u2019re ready to be saved from the daily onslaught of bots?",

        "full_text": "My first sex toy was a bright blue dildo. I was about 19, and as a college student in New Hampshire, I did what anyone in my position would do: hotfooted it to the closest city to find a sex shop. With my best friend in tow, I jetted in and out of the Condom World on Newbury Street so fast that I only had time to grab the first sex toy I saw and pay for it, keeping my head down the whole time. To say the early 2000s were different when it came to sex toy acceptance would be a gross understatement. In my small-town mind, they were something that shouldn\u2019t be discussed and the very definition of the word taboo. But they weren\u2019t taboo enough to keep me from buying that battery-operated blue monstrosity with its exaggerated veins and head. I was embarrassed by it from day one, even more so after I used it, with zero understanding of what I was supposed to get out of it. As I got to know my body better, exploring on my own or during partnered sex, with other toys I purchased, I came to a realization. As much as I love penetration with my partner(s), I didn't particularly enjoy dildos. I found most impersonal, poorly designed, and because it wouldn\u2019t be until my late 30s that I\u2019d finally have an orgasm from G-spot simulation, on a pleasure level, they weren\u2019t for me. This didn\u2019t stop me from trying to get something out of them, especially as I started writing about sexual wellness and suddenly had a world of sex toys and the newest innovations at the tip of my fingers. Lelo Lelo Amazon Nordstrom My feelings on dildos changed drastically with the Lelo Gigi 3. Finally, an internal dildo with a head that was flattened, as opposed to cone-shaped, meaning it covered more of the G-spot area. Breaking news, that's exactly what I needed after all this time. While so many other dildos have rounded heads, which many people love, the flat head of the Gigi 3 is what really sets it apart. It\u2019s not just the shape of the head, but the way it disperses stimulation. Because the eight vibration modes are delivered through the flattened head, the sensations are more intense and rumbly, meaning I can feel them branching out and reaching more nerve endings. People with vulvas are far too often taught that when it comes to sexual pleasure, the focus should be on the clitoris or the G-spot\u2014or both at once\u2014but the reality is that the entire region is chock-full of nerve endings. Hence, the reason people with vulvas can experience orgasms outside these two zones, like via the A-spot (anterior fornix) and the U-spot (urethral sponge). I\u2019m not a size queen. I\u2019m the first to admit that smaller is better when it comes to external vibrators. However, when it comes to internal vibrators, the size and shape of the shaft matter. The Gigi 3 is the ideal size for G-spot stimulation. Even those who have yet to officially find their G-spot can\u2019t possibly miss it when using the Gigi 3 because the length and slight arc of the shaft puts that flattened head exactly where every person with a vulva wants it. For me, I love to put a few drops of water-based lube on the head and shaft of the Gigi 3, get myself comfy, then slide it inside. From there, I can melt into the moment without fumbling with buttons (the Gigi 3 is app-controlled). When I\u2019m not in the mood for internal play, the flat head of the Gigi 3 is great for direct clitoral stimulation or teasing other parts of my vulva. As I\u2019ve learned, just because the labia doesn\u2019t have as many nerve endings as the clitoris doesn\u2019t mean it likes to be ignored. Is the Lelo Gigi 3 my favorite sex toy? No. Depending on the day and my mood, my favorite sex toys and vibrators change. But, if you\u2019re someone with a vulva who has never liked dildos, the Gigi 3 could be your ticket to sexual pleasure. It could also hit the spot if you prefer clitoral stimulation, but want the vibrations to encompass more than just the external tip of the clit. Although the Gigi 3 can be used anywhere, internally and externally, if you have a vulva, this is a must-have.",

Stream the much buzzed-about South Park, fan-favorite Yellowstone, original series MobLand, and rebooted crime drama Dexter & Dexter on Paramount+. The streaming network has a bingeable TV series for almost everyone. And whether you want to remember Lindsay Lohan\u2019s old face in the classic Mean Girls flick, or wonder just how many more sequels Tom Cruise has left in him with Top Gun: Maverick, there\u2019s a bevy of films to stream, too. If you\u2019re like me and have at least half a dozen streaming services, our Paramount+ coupon codes can help you save so you can watch the content you want without having to get rid of one of your other beloved content platforms. (I love pretending the world isn\u2019t full of suffering around me and instead focus on Sylvester Stallone\u2019s ever-changing Play-Doh face in Tulsa King.) If you\u2019re unsure if you\u2019ll actually want to commit to Paramount+, or if there\u2019s a sports event like the Big Game or March Madness games and you only need to access the content for a little while, Paramount+\u2019s free trial is a great option. The trial lasts one week, is for new subscribers only, and can\u2019t be paired with other offers. There are tiered plans, including Essential, which allows for 3 devices, select Showtime series, NFL games, and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but has ads; and Premium, which includes all that except there are no ads, downloadable content, CBS live, and all of Showtime content. It\u2019s important that you choose the right Paramount+ streaming plan for you so that you can get the best bang for your buck. Lucky for you, all plans come with a 7-day free trial so you can make sure you\u2019re choosing the right plan for you. The first is Paramount+ Essential, which is $8 per month. It has ads included, but you\u2019ll have access to over 40,000 episodes and movies. And you\u2019ll be able to stream on 3 devices at once, be able to watch NFL games on CBS and UEFA Champions League, and select Showtime series are also available. Paramount+ Premium is the next tier (and the most popular choice), which starts at $13 per month (after the free trial ends), and you\u2019ll get everything mentioned in the previous tier, without ads. You\u2019ll have all that as well as the ability to watch in 4K UHD, Dolby Vision or HDR10, downloadable movies and shows, streaming CBS live and all of Showtime\u2019s content library. If you find the service isn\u2019t right for you, or just need to cut down on subscriptions, you can cancel Paramount+ any time. However, the cancellation process depends on where you signed up. If you signed up directly on the website, you\u2019ll need to go to your account page. If you\u2019re a student now (or have your student ID lying around somewhere), you can get a Paramount+ plan at only $4 a month. All you have to do is verify your student status and you\u2019ll get 50% off any plan of your choosing for the first year. Or if you\u2019re a military member, Paramount+ gives 50% off any subscription for life. There\u2019s truly something for everyone in the family, with movies, kids\u2019 shows, and Paramount+ originals included in every plan. If you\u2019re feeling spooky, I\u2019d recommend Dexter: Resurrection, or Yellowjackets, but if you\u2019re looking for something more family-friendly, there\u2019s super popular cartoons like Rango or Sonic the Hedgehog to choose from. Looking for specific recommendations? I\u2019ve got you. There are tons of great new releases coming to Paramount+ this month, including Landman season 2, new Paramount+ original comedy series Crutch starring Tracy Morgan, and new episodes of (my favorite) newly premiered Ink Master Season 17. There are also tons of new movies, including The Cut, a boxing drama starring Orlando Bloom, dark comedy Shell, and true-crime tale My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story. Plus, Paramount+ will be playing the important NFL holiday games. Check out the wide breadth of TV and movie content to choose from on Paramount+ (and use the Paramount+ promo codes above to save on whatever plan you decide). For better or worse, I\u2019m a Chiefs fan (cue the booing). I usually get a Paramount+ plan during the football season to keep up with my favorite beefy, TBI-ridden men. You can stream all of the NFL coverage you want all season long, plus, 24/7 live channels are now streaming on Paramount+, so you\u2019ll never need to give your brain the time to process the horrors. Paramount+ has all the man-on-man action you want, from bloody brawls to KO\u2019s. Paramount+ is your one-stop-shop to stream UFC live so you can catch every fight. This includes UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira on February 7, and UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez, airing February 21. The annual tournament that determines which men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I teams will win the NCAA Basketball championships, March Madness, will be streaming on Paramount+ this spring. You can watch any men's March Madness games that are being broadcast on CBS with Paramount+. Let the games begin! If football (or soccer) is more your jam, Paramount+ also has you covered. You can watch Champions League Soccer at Paramount+, including fan favorites and heated rivalries from Real Madrid, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona, and more. With a Paramount+ subscription, you also get so many perks, including tons of CBS content. This means that golf lovers can watch CBS Sports PGA tour, streaming on Paramount+. This includes six signature events and the FedExCup Playoffs. In its 69th consecutive year of broadcasting the PGA TOUR, CBS will also stream games live on Paramount+, including the WM Phoenix Open on February 7 and 8, and The Genesis Invitational on Feb 21 and 22. There\u2019s a game for every golf lover, including coverage of both the PGA tour and The Masters tournament.",

On January 2, 2027, the court had directed Mr. Thakur to \u201cforthwith cease and desist from being associated with the working of BCCI\u201d. A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said Mr. Thakur was \u201chitherto free to participate in the affairs of the BCCI as per the rules and regulations\u201d.  The court had passed the \u2018cease-and-desist\u2019 direction against Mr. Thakur for failure to implement the Justice Lodha Committee reforms in the BCCI.  The Bench of Chief Justice Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi on Thursday (February 5) lifted the embargo on Mr. Thakur considering the fact that he had given an unconditional apology and he has been unconnected with the BCCI for nine years now.

Janardhan Reddy lashed out at the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) for neglecting the Rayalaseema region when it was in power and now making a hue and cry over the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme, the construction of which was stopped during the YSRCP regime. Reacting to the YSRCP holding Chalo Pothireddypadu protest in Nandyal district on Thursday (February 05), Mr. Janardhan Reddy questioned as to why the former chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy maintained silence when the Rayalaseema lift works were halted by the National Green Tribunal in 2020 itself. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy even failed to file a counter in the subsequent four years, he said and alleged that the YSRCP president is trying to instigate regional feelings with his protests. The Minister said that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy did not even spend \u20b92 lakh crore for Rayalaseema even as \u20b912 lakh crore was allocated in the Budget during his tenure. \u201cMr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had scrapped the drip irrigation project that would have benefitted the region. He had pre-closed 102 projects in Rayalaseema region. I dare Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy for a debate on development of Rayalaseema,\u201d Mr. Janardhan Reddy said. The Minister said the previous TDP government had started 13 pumps of Muchumarri project in 2017 itself but Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy did not take forward the project fearing that the credit would go to the TDP and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. \u201cMr. Chandrababu Naidu has turned drought-prone Anantapur into a horticulture hub and had spent \u20b98,000 crore in just 19 months. Development works to the tune of \u20b95,000 crore are taking place in Orvakal and Kopparthi,\u201d Mr. Janardhan Reddy added. Further, investments to the tune of \u20b94.5 lakh crore are coming up in Rayalaseema which will provide jobs to the youth of the region. Stating that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy has no moral right to speak about development of Rayalaseema, the Minister said they are ready for a debate on the issue on the floor of State Assembly and asked the YSRCP chief to participate in the same with his 11 MLAs.

He said that Opposition party was trying to divert the attention of the people with regard to use of adulterated ghee for the preparation of Laddu prasadam of Tirumala.  He distributed CM relief fund cheques to beneficiaries in Rajam of Vizianagaram district. Speaking to media on the occasion, he said the Telugu Desam Party had never crossed its limits and adopted only clean politics in spite of ups and downs in its political journey.  He asked the Opposition party MLAs to attend ensuring Assembly session and raise the public issues instead of adopting hate politics in the State. Mr. Muralimohan would not believe the Opposition party in future as it had completely lost the confidence of the people.

Filing a counter affidavit in response to an appeal filed by Youreka Cinema School, which had produced the movie Lakshmi-Lawrence Kadhal, CBFC Chennai Regional Officer D. Balamurali said, the board certifies films, including promos and trailers, for public exhibition in theatres and television channels in accordance with the Cinematograph Act, 1952 and Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024. He said, Section 5B(2) of the 1952 Act empowers the Centre to issue such directions as it may think fit, setting out the principles which shall guide the CBFC in sanctioning films for public exhibition. In exercise of such power, the Centre had issued elaborate guidelines to assist the members of the examining committees and revising committees in arriving at a decision. \u2018Jana Nayagan\u2019 censor row: Can\u2019t reveal anything, says CBFC Regional Officer Madras High Court lauds Tamil movie Manushi, orders issue of censor certificate after necessary cuts The CBFC was duty bound to ensure visuals or words contemptuous of racial, religious or other groups or which promote communal, obscurantist, anti-scientific and anti-national attitude were not presented in a movie. It was also the duty of the board to ensure public order does not get endangered because of the screening of a movie for public exhibition. Accordingly, both the five member examining committee as well as a nine member revising committee had unanimously decided Lakshmi-Lawrence Kadhal was not fit for certification because \u201cit portrays its interpretation of various belief systems in their adaption of modern science, rituals based on beliefs, treatment of women and downtrodden and caste-based discrimination and consistently portrays one belief system in bad light and the other one as emancipating.\u201d  The counter affidavit also stated \u201cthe refusal of certification is not founded upon any stray or isolated scene or dialogue, but upon the cumulative effect of the film viewed in its entirety. The film, as a whole, persistently portrays a particular section of society in a derogatory and prejudicial manner. The potential for incitement of disharmony and social unrest is not speculative but imminent and real.\u201d Mr. Balamurali went on to state: \u201cSuch narratives are bound to disrupt public order and undermine social harmony. The contents capable of provoking communal disharmony or widespread social unrest cannot be cloaked under the guise of freedom of expression.\u201d After the counter affidavit filed by CBFC counsel K.R. Samratt was served upon the producer\u2019s counsel M. Santhanaraman, the judge adjourned the hearing to February 11.

The model will mark Nissan\u2019s return to the midsize SUV space. While the latest test mule is heavily camouflaged, proportions suggest a conventional upright SUV stance with a long wheelbase and short overhangs. The vehicle seen here appears to be riding on large 18-inch alloy wheels with 225-section tyres.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tekton is a badge-engineered version of the new Duster, just as the <a href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/new-2013-nissan-terrano-review-test-drive-357283\">Nissan Terrano</a> was based on the old Duster.

        "full_text": "Image credits: Rushlane Nissan\u2019s upcoming midsize SUV, the Tekton, has been spied testing again in India, giving us the first-ever glimpse of its interior. The model will mark Nissan\u2019s return to the midsize SUV space. While the latest test mule is heavily camouflaged, proportions suggest a conventional upright SUV stance with a long wheelbase and short overhangs. The vehicle seen here appears to be riding on large 18-inch alloy wheels with 225-section tyres.\u00a0 The Tekton is a badge-engineered version of the new Duster, just as the Nissan Terrano was based on the old Duster. The Tekton will feature different design elements inspired by larger Nissan models while remaining mechanically identical to the Duster. Despite concealed body panels, some design cues are visible through the camouflage. The Tekton is expected to feature a Nissan-specific front fascia rather than mirroring its Renault counterpart. The lighting signature appears to include slim, wide-set daytime running lamps and a conventional lighting setup with a full-width LED strip. The side profile looks relatively clean, with less pronounced body cladding. At the rear, the tail-lamp area appears to be horizontally oriented, and a wide tailgate surface can be made out, though light graphics remain hidden.

        "summary_rss": "The nameplate returns in the second half of 2028.",
        "full_text": "Selling cars in today\u2019s fiercely competitive market isn\u2019t easy, but the job does come with perks. Automakers typically gain access to new products years ahead of launch, giving them plenty of time to prepare for the arrival of fresh metal. Such is the case for Nissan dealers, who have been allowed an early look at the revival of a long-awaited nameplate: the Xterra. This week in Las Vegas, Nissan showed the new Xterra behind closed doors during a North American Automotive Dealer Show (NADA) meeting. Automotive News cites Scott Smith, president of the Smith Automotive Group near Atlanta, saying the hotly anticipated SUV will be worth the wait. The two-row off-roader is described as \u201cradical-looking,\u201d with design cues inspired by the original model but modernized for the late 2020s. The resurrected Xterra is expected to ride on a newly developed body-on-frame platform, with a design that has \u201can aggression to it,\u201d according to Charlie Hicks, CEO of Hicks Automotive Group in Texas. Those who have seen it say Nissan is aiming for a rugged look, featuring a beefy grille and an overall emphasis on toughness. The third-generation Xterra is slated to launch in the second half of 2028 and should cost less than $40,000, according to the company\u2019s Senior Vice President Michael Soutter. AN reports the brawny, go-anywhere vehicle won\u2019t arrive alone, as a more luxurious Infiniti counterpart is also planned, presumably with a higher price tag. Nissan has a busy agenda ahead, since the new architecture is also expected to underpin the next Pathfinder, Frontier, and QX60. All of these models are said to offer \u201celectrified\u201d powertrains, meaning hybrid and/or plug-in hybrid options. Meanwhile, the next-generation Rogue should break cover later this year and reach the market in 2027. While the NADA meeting mostly revolved around SUVs and trucks, one car was also mentioned by Nissan. Dealers learned the seven-year-old Altima is getting a stay of execution, but the midsize sedan will inevitably bow out at the end of summer 2027. There\u2019s no mention of a successor, leaving the new Sentra as the sole surviving car following the recent axing of the entry-level Versa. Motor1's Take:\u00a0A new Xterra can\u2019t come soon enough, as rugged SUVs remain all the rage in North America. Reviving a once-popular nameplate and leaning into off-road capability with a two-speed transfer case (including low range) should appeal to buyers seeking alternatives to the Toyota 4Runner. The Infiniti version, however, may face an unexpected rival by the time it reaches the market. BMW is reportedly plotting its own rugged SUV to lure buyers away from the Mercedes G-Class and Land Rover Defender.

        "summary_rss": "The Transporter gets a new flagship version with strong GTI vibes.",
        "full_text": "Ford may have a long history of selling sporty-looking vans in Europe, but Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles now wants a piece of that action as well. To make it happen, it\u2019s giving the Transporter a new range-topping trim that channels a GTI vibe into a genuinely attractive hauler. With no real business case for a performance-oriented van, however, the Sportline is all show, with no extra go. Since we mentioned Ford, it\u2019s worth remembering that the latest Transporter is largely based on the Transit Custom. In this new GTI-esque configuration, it receives a beefy body kit available in several flavors. While the images show the five-seat Kombi version, customers can also opt for the panel van. Both body styles are offered in short- and long-wheelbase configurations. Beyond its meaner styling, this spicy Transporter stands out with exclusive 19-inch wheels that ditch the usual VW logos in favor of Sportline branding. It also gets a lowered sports suspension with Eibach springs, dropping the ride height by 1.1 inches (29 millimeters). The most daring feature is found at the rear, where a split roof spoiler makes it clear this isn\u2019t your typical workhorse. Up front, the grille\u2019s red accent stripe looks lifted straight from the Polo GTI or Golf GTI. If you\u2019d rather have a true GTI model that hasn\u2019t been sold before, the ID.2 Polo GTI is coming later this year, albeit without a combustion engine. As the flagship version, the Sportline comes loaded as standard. VW includes everything from matrix LED headlights and roof rails to a heated steering wheel and illuminated metal door sill plates. The GTI-like red finish is contrasted by glossy black accents, including the electrically adjustable, heated mirrors. Mind you, this isn\u2019t the first time the Transporter has received the Sportline treatment. VW gave the previous-generation T6.1 a more aggressive makeover a few years ago. As with its predecessor, the newcomer leaves the drivetrains untouched. Whether buyers choose diesel, plug-in hybrid, or fully electric power, there\u2019s no extra grunt over a regular model. Motor1's Take:\u00a0Vans aren\u2019t supposed to be sporty, but they certainly look more appealing when impersonating a GTI. The Transporter Sportline serves as an alternative to the mechanically related Ford Transit Custom vans modified by MS-RT and sold directly through Ford Pro. Europeans are spoiled for choice when it comes to vans that look fast but actually aren\u2019t. Stellantis, for example, is well versed in this niche, offering the Citro\u00ebn Dispatch VTR, Opel Vivaro GS, Fiat Scudo Onyx, and Peugeot Expert Sport. Renault\u2019s Trafic Extra Sport is more subtle, but it, too, tries to inject some excitement into the typically dull van segment.

        "summary_rss": "The spirit of the quirky hatchback will be revived for a new entry-level EV.",
        "full_text": "Audi is gearing up for a busy 2026, with multiple product launches locked in for the remainder of the year. While enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the new RS5, the SUV-loving crowd has its eyes on the next-generation Q7 and the first-ever Q9. At the other end of the lineup, Ingolstadt is set to shake things up by both adding and subtracting models. Long confirmed to bow out after the current generation, the A1 supermini is expected to retire by year\u2019s end. The subcompact hatchback will likely exit the lineup alongside its crossover sibling, the Q2. Indirectly replacing both models will be a completely different newcomer, reviving a moniker last used about two decades ago: A2. While the original A2 was far from a commercial success due to its high price and quirky styling, Audi hopes its spiritual successor will fare better. The German luxury brand has already confirmed plans to introduce an entry-level EV in 2026, and senior sources within the company have told Autocar it will carry the A2 designation. Our exclusive rendering draws on recent spy shots of a camouflaged prototype undergoing final testing. It won\u2019t be as polarizing as the original A2, nor will it fully embrace the new design language previewed by the Concept C. The small electric hatchback was penned while Marc Lichte was still overseeing Audi\u2019s design team, before Massimo Frascella was appointed Head of Design in 2024. It remains to be seen whether Frascella has left his mark on the A2, but logic suggests the car\u2019s design had already been frozen by the time he arrived in Ingolstadt. Whatever the case, Audi\u2019s cheapest electric vehicle will feature split headlights. Elsewhere, traditional door handles are absent, replaced by tiny winglets integrated into the beltline for a layout also seen on the Ford Mustang Mach-E. The newcomer will predictably slot below the Q4 E-Tron and is likely to carry the same suffix as Audi\u2019s other EVs. The A2 E-Tron will be closely related to the Volkswagen ID.3, possibly the updated version due soon. Interestingly, Autocar notes that Audi aims to lure buyers who miss the BMW i3 hatchback, which was retired in 2022. Coincidentally, Munich is also reviving the i3 name, though it\u2019s being repurposed for an electric sedan in the 3 Series segment. Given Audi\u2019s premium positioning, the A2 is expected to command a price premium over its mainstream ID.3 sibling. VW charges \u20ac33,330 for the base version in Germany, so it\u2019s reasonable to assume the tuxedo-wearing cousin will cost north of \u20ac35,000. Motor1's Take:\u00a0The new A2 will be an intriguing addition to an electric luxury segment dominated by far larger and more expensive vehicles. Its styling likely won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, but we appreciate Audi for injecting some of the original model\u2019s funkiness into its indirect successor. We wouldn\u2019t count on seeing the A2 E-Tron in the United States, given its small footprint. After all, VW doesn\u2019t sell the ID.3 in North America either. In Europe, however, it stands a better chance of success than the original A2, helped by the steadily growing appetite for EVs. In 2025, purely electric cars accounted for 19.5 percent of all vehicles sold across the 27 EU countries, plus the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

        "summary_rss": "Kia is killing off its forgotten Niro plug-in hybrid for the 2026 model year.",
        "full_text": "Another one bites the dust. With nine vehicles already slated to disappear by 2027, Kia is adding one more to the list. The Niro PHEV is dead for 2026. The company confirmed the news in a statement to Kelley Blue Book, saying, \"Due to changing market conditions, the 2026 Niro PHEV will no longer be available in the US market.\" 2023 Kia Niro PHEV\u00a0 This move shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. The plug-in hybrid was always the odd one out in the Niro lineup, playing third fiddle to both the standard gas model and the fully electric version. Kia sold just 31,182 Niro models in total last year, with the PHEV likely accounting for the smallest slice of that figure (the company doesn\u2019t break down sales by powertrain). The good news\u2014for now\u2014is that the gas-powered Niro and the Niro EV are expected to stick around through 2027. Motor1's Take: This isn\u2019t the first plug-in hybrid to meet its maker in 2027, and it likely won\u2019t be the last. With fewer buyers seemingly interested in plug-in hybrids in the US, companies are killing off the slow-selling models seemingly by the dozen.

        "full_text": "The cold can't stop a Bugatti owner from enjoying their amazing machine. The annual ICE at St. Moritz proves to be the perfect playground for these hypercars, as evidenced by the video below.\u00a0 Bugatti brought out a handful of machines that celebrate its lineage, both classic and current. From a scaled-down Type 35 and what looks to be\u00a0a gorgeous Type 51, on up to a trio of ballistic Bolide hyper-exotics, the range of cars looked resplendent on the ice and snow-covered course.\u00a0 Anytime you find this many Bugatti models in one place, it's safe to assume this is a special occasion. I think what's most impressive, however, is the amount of traction the drivers found in these conditions. Yes, the Veyrons and Bolides have all-wheel drive. But that's a whole lot of power being put down to a rather slippery and cold surface. I'm curious whether someone makes snow tires for these cars. And, if so, I'm also quite curious what a set of those would run. Which car was the coolest car out there (no pun intended)? My vote goes for the person driving the EB110. While it's down on power compared to the wicked machines around it, that car is quite indicative of its era and remains a major milestone on the timeline of all things supercar. The\u00a0actual\u00a0coolest people out there are the people in the vintage open wheelers, of course. Motor1's Take: Watching high-dollar, high-horsepower machinery drifting across a snowy landscape is a sight to behold. We applaud any such super and hypercar owners willing to fully enjoy the capabilities of their cars.
